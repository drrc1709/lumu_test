# Word Frequency Counter

This project provides a Python script to analyze a text file. It counts the number of words and characters and displays the frequency of each word in descending order. The script also generates a histogram that shows the word frequencies visually.

## Features

- Counts the total number of words in a text file.
- Counts the total number of characters (excluding spaces) in the text.
- Displays the frequency of each word in descending order.
- Generates a bar chart (histogram) of word frequencies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `matplotlib` (for generating the histogram)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:

    ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
Place your text in a file called texto.txt in the project directory.

Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will:

* Count the words and characters.
* Print the word frequencies in descending order.
* Display a histogram showing the word frequencies.
